## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
For this project, we are developing an Event Planner app. This app is designed to help its user keep track of the dates and times of upcoming events. The app should have two data tables, one that stores event detail and another that stores user login information. It should have a login screen, a grid display of upcoming events, that allows its users to make changes to events, and a system of sending its users app notifications. 

--What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
When completing this application I needed a Login screen, a Home screen, the Event Details screen, and the Settings screen. My designs for each screen were done with the user in mind, as such each screen was focused on minimizing user effort, anticipating user needs, and providing an interactive design.

--How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
The coding process of the app first began by understanding the user needs and app requirements. Once I gathered the required information, I researched other similar and successful apps to better understand what resonates with the app's users. With all this in mind, I moved on to the front-end and back-end development of the app. When completing any future applications I will have a better understanding of the process of developing a user-centered and well-designed application.

--How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
In order to ensure that my application was functional I had to utilize the Android Studio emulator to test the code and its functionalities. The emulator was very insightful as it allowed me to see how my application would perform on various platforms and which areas of the code weren't functional.

--Considering the complete app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
When completing my application I found it extremely challenging to use Android Studio. The software was extremely slow and continuously lagged. It became quite frustrating when I was attempting to complete assignments considering it took a considerable amount of time to complete a single task. I eventually had to turn to the internet to find ways in which I could increase the software speed. In the end, I had to tell Andriod Studio to ignore certain files that were taking up too much memory, and then I resorted to only using code for the app design as using Android Studioâ€™s design editor had far too much lag.

--In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
One component of my mobile app where I was particularly successful in demonstrating my skills and experience is my user Login page. This page demonstrates industry best design practices and user-centered app development skills.
